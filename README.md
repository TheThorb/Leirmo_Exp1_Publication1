# Leirmo_Exp1_Publication1
This repository contains data, code and figures for the first publication of results from the first experiment of Torbj√∏rn Langedahl Leirmo.
The repository is established in relation to a scientific publication where the results are disseminated.
Links will be provided shortly after publication.
Any inquiries may be directed to torbjorn.leirmo@ntnu.no.


## Dependencies
The code is developed in a Windows 10 operating system using Python 3.
The following list contain all dependencies and the appropriate versions.

 - Matplotlib v3.3.3
 - Numpy v1.19.5
 - Pandas v1.2.0
 - Scipy v1.6.0
 - Seaborn v0.11.1


## Contents
The repository contain folders of data, figures and plots, as  well as files of source code and notebooks for data analysis.
The notebooks are numbered according to the logical progression of analyzing the data, namely:

1. Analyze repeated measurements
2. Comparison of builds
3. Analysis of variation along the z-axis of the build chamber
4. Analysis of variation in the xy-plane

There are two Python-files of source code. These files contain utility functions used in one or more of the notebooks.

* "my_functions.py": Primarily functions for reading and saving data, as well as functions for handlig lists of dataframes.
* "my_plot.py": Functions for plotting data


### Folders
"data": This folder contain data related to the experiment.
 - "data_description.txt": Textual description of the data
 - "leirmo_exp1_layout.csv": Information about the experiment layout (placement of specimens)
 - "layput_data.pkl": Pickled version of the layout information for quick read
 - "Leirmo_Exp1_ALL.csv": Table with all data directly exported from the coordinate measuring machine (i.e. no layout information)
 - "prep_data.pkl": Pickled version of all data from coordinate measuring machine
 - "T-test_Angle_Cylindricity.csv": Results from T-test of angle versus cylindricity
 - "T-test_Z-dir_Cylinders.csv": Results from T-test of Z-direction versus cylindricity
 
"figs": Figures used as illustrations in notebooks.
 - "layout_positions.png": A visualization of the different positions in the build chamber (x, y and z- direction)
 - "specimen_with_labels.png": Figure displaying the test artifact where the features are labelled
 
"plots": Plots and the code for their creation. Separate contents file is found in the folder.
